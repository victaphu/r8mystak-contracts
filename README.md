# R8MyStak Smart Contracts

This project uses Chainlink functions and the Lensprotocol to aggregate likes.
Likes are converted to STK tokens. Users need to synchronise by clicking SYNC.

In this way, users can 'farm' likes and 'claim' STK tokens when its beneficial based on likes on tiktok, instagram, and lens.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
